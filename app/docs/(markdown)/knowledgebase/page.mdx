# BioContextAI Tools and Resources

BioContextAI provides access to biomedical data and analysis capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The available tools and resources depend on the current configuration of the BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP and the broader registry of community-contributed servers.

## What tools are available?

BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP exposes tools for querying biomedical knowledge bases and performing domain-specific tasks. The exact set of tools may change as new resources are integrated. To see the current list of tools and their descriptions, use your MCP-compatible client&apos;s tool discovery features, or consult the [BioContextAI Registry](/registry/biocontext-ai/knowledgebase-mcp).

**Typical capabilities include:**

- Querying protein-protein interaction databases (e.g., STRING)
- Accessing cell type marker information (e.g., PanglaoDB)
- Retrieving protein expression data (e.g., Human Protein Atlas)
- Exploring biological pathways (e.g., Reactome)
- Searching for biomedical research funding opportunities

## How to use BioContextAI tools

1. **Connect your MCP-compatible client** (see installation guides for IDEs or chatbots)
2. **Discover available tools**: Most clients will show a list of available tools after connecting to the server. Tool names and descriptions are provided by the server itself.
3. **Formulate your query**: Ask questions relevant to the connected databases or resources. For best results, be specific and reference the database or resource if needed.

**Example queries:**

- "What proteins interact with TP53?"
- "Summarize markers for liver cell types according to PanglaoDB with a minimum specificity of 0.1. List them by cell type as a table."
- "Find recent NIH grants related to kidney research."

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Reference the database or resource if you want to target a particular tool.
- **Check tool documentation**: Use the tool descriptions provided by the server or see the [BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP repository](https://github.com/biocontext-ai/knowledgebase-mcp).
- **Break down complex tasks**: For multi-step analyses, consider breaking your query into simpler steps.
