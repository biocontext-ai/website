# Add BioContextAI to your Chatbot

BioContextAI can be used with chatbots that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP), such as Claude Desktop. This enables chatbots to access biomedical data and analysis tools provided by BioContextAI.

## General Steps

1. **Install an MCP-compatible chatbot** (e.g., Claude Desktop)
2. **Add the BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP**:

- Using the following URL: `https://mcp.biocontext.ai/mcp/`
- Or using our Python package: `biocontext-kb` (**recommended**)

3. **Configure the server** in your chatbot&apos;s MCP settings (usually under "MCP" or "Tool Servers").
4. **Restart the chatbot** if required.
5. **Test the integration** by asking a biomedical question.

### Example: Claude Desktop

1. Download and install [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Open settings and select "Developer" -> "Edit Config"
3. Add a new server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

<CodeBlock
  language="json"
  value={`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocontext_kb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["biocontext_kb"]
    }
  }
}`}
/>

4. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop
5. Try a biomedical query, such as:
   - "What proteins interact with STAT3?"
   - "Which Reactome pathways contain MKI67?"

If you encounter any errors, try restarting Claude Desktop or updating it to the latest version. Uninstalling and reinstalling `mcp-remote` might also help. If you still encounter issues after that, please open an issue in the [BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP GitHub repository](https://github.com/biocontext-ai/knowledgebase-mcp).

#### Claude Pro/Max

If you have a Claude Pro or Max subscription, you can simply navigate to `Settings > Profile`, click on `Integrations` and then `Add more`. There, you can paste in `https://mcp.biocontext.ai/mcp/` and then click `Add`.
**Note:** Currently, this integration is broken because of specialized authentication requirements. We are working on a fix. Please use the `biocontext-kb` Python package as described above for now.

## Using BioContextAI Knowledgebase MCP

- Ask questions relevant to biomedical research, referencing specific databases or resources if needed.
- For best results, be specific and describe all necessary steps.
- Performing one step at a time may improve results, e.g., asking for the id in a database first before asking for a query to that database.
- The set of available tools depends on the current server configuration. Use your chatbot&apos;s tool discovery features to see what&apos;s available.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tools not showing**: Ensure the server is enabled and restart the chatbot.
- **Connection errors**: Verify the URL and your internet connection.
- **Authorization**: BioContextAI is free to use and does not require an API key.
- **Rate limits**: For high-throughput use, consider [deploying your own instance](https://github.com/biocontext-ai/knowledgebase-mcp).
