# BioContextAI Governance Structure

## Community

The BioContextAI community consists of anyone using, developing with, or contributing to the project in any way - including users of the Registry, developers of community MCP servers, and contributors to BioContextAI-maintained infrastructure and services. We welcome and value contributors from all backgrounds, identities, and experience levels, and are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where diverse perspectives strengthen our collective impact on biomedical research.

## Contributors

Community members become contributors by:

- Submitting MCP servers to the Registry
- Contributing code, documentation, or bug reports to BioContextAI repositories
- Participating in discussions on GitHub issues or community forums
- Helping with community support, documentation or events

All contributors must adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](/docs/community/conduct). We actively encourage participation from underrepresented groups in technology and science, recognizing that diverse voices and perspectives are essential for building tools that serve the global biomedical research community.

Repeat community contributors with demonstrated interest in continued contributions may request to join the GitHub organization for enhanced collaboration privileges.
