# MCP Server Template

## Getting Started

For development of custom MCP servers that are compatible with the BioContextAI registry, we provide an easy-to-use template for developers. The template is available at [https://github.com/biocontext-ai/mcp-server-cookiecutter](https://github.com/biocontext-ai/mcp-server-cookiecutter).

### Using the Template

Use this template with `cookiecutter` by running:

<CodeBlock language="bash" value="uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/biocontext-ai/mcp-server-cookiecutter.git" />

Alternatively, you can install `cookiecutter` with pip:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  value={`python3 -m pip install --user cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/biocontext-ai/mcp-server-cookiecutter.git`}
/>

After running `cookiecutter`, you will be asked to provide the package name, project name and description, as well as author name and email. This information will be included in the generated package as metadata.

## Development Setup

After generating your package from the template, you can set up your development environment using either traditional virtual environments or uv:

### Using uv (recommended)

<CodeBlock language="bash" value={`# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies and run your server

cd your-package-directory
uv sync`} />

### Using traditional virtual environment

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  value={`python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .`}
/>

## Running Your MCP Server

Once your package is set up, you can run your MCP server in several ways:

### Using uvx (simplest)

<CodeBlock language="bash" value="uvx your_package_name" />

### Using installed package

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  value={`# After installing with pip or uv
your_package_name --transport stdio
# or for HTTP transport
your_package_name --transport http --port 3000`}
/>

### Client Configuration

To include your MCP server in clients that support the `mcp.json` standard:

<CodeBlock
  language="json"
  value={`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-server-name": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["your_package_name"],
      "env": {
        "UV_PYTHON": "3.12"
      }
    }
  }
}`}
/>

## Publishing Your Package

We recommend publishing your MCP server through PyPI so that it can be installed through `uv` and `pip`. The template includes a `release.yaml` GitHub Action that automates this process:

1. **Set up PyPI trusted publishing**: Add your GitHub repository as a trusted publisher in your PyPI account
2. **Create a release**: Create a release on your GitHub repository
3. **Automatic publishing**: The included GitHub Action will automatically publish to PyPI

Once published, users can install your server with:

<CodeBlock language="bash" value={`# Using uvx (install and run)
uvx your_package_name

# Using uv (add to existing setup)

uv add your_package_name

# Using pip

pip install your_package_name`} />

## Testing

The template includes a basic testing setup. Run tests with:

<CodeBlock language="bash" value={`uv run pytest`} />

## Documentation

The template includes configuration for building documentation with Read the Docs. For detailed setup instructions, see the generated README in your project.

## Submit to BioContextAI Registry

To make your MCP server discoverable to the community, please consider submitting it to the BioContextAI Registry:

1. **Create metadata**: Use our online editor at [https://biocontext.ai/registry/editor](https://biocontext.ai/registry/editor) to create the required metadata file
2. **Open a pull request**: Submit your metadata file to the Registry repository
3. **Review process**: We will review your submission and include it in the Registry
4. **Community announcement**: Approved servers are announced on social media
