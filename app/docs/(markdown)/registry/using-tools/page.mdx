# Using Registry Tools

This guide explains how to discover, install, and use MCP servers from the BioContextAI Registry in your research workflows.

> **⚠️ Security Notice**: Third-party MCP servers can access your system resources and execute commands. Always review the server&apos;s source code and only install servers from trusted sources. Check the repository, maintainer reputation, and required permissions before installation.

## Finding Tools

- Visit the [Registry](/registry) to browse and search for available MCP servers.
- Each server entry includes:
  - **Description**: Overview of the server&apos;s capabilities
  - **Documentation**: Links to the server&apos;s README and additional resources
  - **Installation Config**: Configuration files (mcp.json) for easy setup
  - **Available Tools**: List of all tools provided by the server with their schemas
  - **Installation Instructions**: Platform-specific setup guides for multiple AI assistants

## Installation Methods

The BioContextAI Registry provides installation instructions for multiple AI assistants and platforms:

### Claude Desktop & Claude Code

**Claude Desktop:**

Claude Desktop allows you to connect MCP servers by editing a configuration file. The configuration file is located at:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Setup Steps:**

1. Open Claude Desktop and click on the Claude menu in your system's menu bar
2. Select "Settings..." then navigate to the "Developer" tab
3. Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file
4. Add the MCP server configuration from the registry's `mcp.json` tab
5. Save the file and completely quit and restart Claude Desktop
6. Look for the MCP server indicator (🔨) in the bottom-right corner of the input box

**Example Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@package/name"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For HTTP servers:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Security Note:** Only configure servers you trust, as they run with your user account permissions.

**Troubleshooting:**

- Check logs at `~/Library/Logs/Claude` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs` (Windows)
- Verify file paths are absolute, not relative
- Ensure Node.js or Python (for uvx) is installed
- Try manually running the server command to check for errors

### Cursor

Cursor supports one-click installation via MCP Install Links:

**One-Click Install (Recommended):**
Each server in the registry provides a Cursor deeplink button that automatically installs the MCP server. Click the "Install in Cursor" button on the server&apos;s detail page.

**Manual Installation:**

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd+,)
2. Navigate to MCP section
3. Add the server configuration from the provided JSON

## Transport Types

MCP servers in the registry use different transport mechanisms:

### HTTP Transport

Servers with HTTP transport provide a URL endpoint:

- Typically accessed via `http://localhost:PORT/mcp` or a remote URL
- Requires the server to be running before connecting
- May support SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses

### Stdio Transport

Servers with stdio transport run as command-line tools:

**NPM Packages** (using npx):

```bash
npx -y <package-name>
```

**Python Packages** (using uvx):

```bash
uvx <package-name>
```

> **Note:** Some AI assistants require `uvx` to be installed separately. On macOS, you can install it via Homebrew:
>
> ```bash
> brew install uv
> ```

These servers communicate via standard input/output and are automatically started by your AI assistant.

## Integrating Registry MCP Servers

1. **Find the server** in the [Registry](/registry)
2. **Review the installation instructions** on the server&apos;s detail page
3. **Copy the mcp.json configuration** or use the platform-specific commands
4. **Install using your preferred AI assistant** (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, or VS Code)
5. **Restart your client** if required
6. **Test the connection** by asking your AI assistant to use one of the server&apos;s tools

## Using Multiple Servers

- Most MCP clients support connecting to multiple servers simultaneously
- You can combine tools from different servers in your workflows
- Be specific in your queries if you want to target a particular server or tool
- Each server&apos;s tools are namespaced to avoid conflicts
