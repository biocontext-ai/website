# BioContextAI Registry

The **BioContextAI Registry** is a community-driven catalog of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for biomedical research. It enables researchers and developers to discover, access, and contribute specialized tools and databases through a standardized protocol.

The registry is available at: [https://biocontext.ai/registry](/registry)
It can also be downloaded as Schema.org-compliant JSON at: [https://biocontext.ai/registry.json](/registry.json)
The JSON schema for the registry is available at: [https://biocontext.ai/schema.json](/schema.json)

## What is the Registry?

- **Searchable directory**: Find MCP servers providing biomedical tools and resources
- **Templates and standards**: Guidance for creating and maintaining MCP servers
- **Community governance**: The registry evolves through community contributions
- **Open source**: All registry servers are open source and free for academic use

## How does it work?

- The [Registry](/registry) lists available biomedical MCP servers, with metadata and links to documentation and source code.
- Each server is maintained by its own developers and may have different capabilities, requirements, and maturity levels.
- You can integrate any listed server with your MCP-compatible client by following the server&apos;s documentation and using its MCP endpoint URL if available or installing it locally.

> We cannot perform a full security-check of listed MCP servers. You should perform your own assessment and limit the access and the data that you provide to MCP servers.

## Benefits

- **Discover specialized tools** for biomedical AI
- **Access diverse resources** through a unified protocol
- **Contribute and share** your own MCP servers
- **Avoid duplicated effort** by building on community solutions

## Important Considerations

- Each server is independently maintained; check documentation for support and updates
- Some servers may have rate limits, API key requirements, or usage constraints
- Always review security and privacy implications before connecting to third-party servers
